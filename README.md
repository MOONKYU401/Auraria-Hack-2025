## 📌 Problem

Recycling and composting in the U.S. is confusing, especially in Colorado where the statewide recycling and composting rate is only **15.5%**. Due to lack of consistent education, access, and infrastructure:

- People are unsure what goes where  
- Contamination ruins recyclable batches  
- Landfills receive unnecessary waste  
- Cities miss out on environmental and financial benefits

---

## 💡 Our Solution: sustAI-n

`sustAI-n` is a smart, interactive web app that allows users to:

- 📸 Upload or capture an image of their waste  
- 🤖 Use an AI model to classify the image as **Recyclable**, **Compost**, or **Landfill**  
- 📊 Display the confidence level of the prediction  

This lightweight tool helps individuals make more sustainable choices — instantly.

- Built with **Teachable Machine**  
- Exported to **Keras** (`.h5`) for local inference  
- Classes trained:  
  - Recyclable  
  - Compost  
  - Landfill  
- Deployed using **TensorFlow**, **Flask**, and **React**

## 🧪 How to Run It Locally

### 🔹 Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-team/sustain-recycling.git
cd Waste-classification
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Start the Flask Backend

```bash
cd ..
.\myenv\Scripts\activate            # Activate Python virtual env (Windows)
pip install flask flask-cors pillow numpy tensorflow
python Waste-classification/server.py
```

> ✅ **Make sure** `keras_Model.h5` and `labels.txt` are in the same directory as `server.py`.

### 🔹 Step 3: Start the React Frontend

```bash
cd Waste-classification
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 🔹 Step 4: Open in Browser

```
http://localhost:5173
```
